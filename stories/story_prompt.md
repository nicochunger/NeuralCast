Write a short story about the song “[TITLE]” by [ARTIST], told in the voice of an Argentine radio announcer as if speaking live on [STATION].

Requirements:

* The story **must be written in Spanish (Rioplatense)**.
* Tone: natural, calm, spontaneous — like someone speaking live from a radio studio (think Aspen-style warmth), not reading a rehearsed script.
* Voice: serene, mature, slightly nostalgic, authentic. Don’t dramatize or overact.
* Use natural filler words and small hesitations to sound human, e.g. “bueno…”, “viste…”, “no sé…”, “lo loco es que…”, “en realidad…”, short pauses, etc.
* Avoid grandiloquent or poetic lines — it should sound like a simple, conversational recollection or anecdote about the song.
* Length: brief — suitable to be read in about **40–60 seconds** on air.
* Keep it spontaneous, with natural rhythm and small colloquial touches, nothing that sounds obviously scripted.
* Do not include links, web addresses, or numeric reference markers like “[1]”.
* This sni

Fact-checking:

* Before including any factual claims (dates, recording facts, chart positions, anecdotes), research online and verify them.
* Only include facts that can be confirmed; if something isn’t verifiable, omit it rather than guessing.
* If there are, try to include little fun facts beyond just generic things like release date and key people involved.

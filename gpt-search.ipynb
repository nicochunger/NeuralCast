      "**Archbishop Criticizes President Milei's Austerity Measures**\n",
      "\n",
      "During a sermon commemorating Argentina's May Revolution, Archbishop Jorge Garcia Cuerva of Buenos Aires criticized President Javier Milei's economic policies, highlighting their adverse effects on the poor and pensioners. Addressing Milei and his cabinet at the Te Deum ceremony, Garcia Cuerva expressed concern over the erosion of societal values and the marginalization of vulnerable groups. He emphasized the struggles of the elderly in accessing essential needs amid severe public spending cuts. Since assuming office in late 2023, Milei's austerity measures have led to weekly protests by pensioners facing hardship and police repression.

      "**Low Voter Turnout in Buenos Aires Reflects Growing Political Apathy**\n",
      "\n",
      "The local elections in Buenos Aires on May 18, 2025, witnessed alarmingly low voter participation, with some neighborhoods recording turnout as low as 37.5%. This historic abstention underscores a growing disinterest and distrust in the political system, particularly among the lower and middle classes. Analysts attribute this apathy to perceptions that politicians fail to address everyday issues and a prevailing sense of democratic fatigue. Despite mandatory voting laws, minimal penalties for non-compliance further discourage participation. President Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, maintained a leading position, even among foreign voters, though overall engagement was low. Traditional right-wing party Pro experienced a significant decline, finishing third. Experts warn that this electoral disengagement could profoundly impact the upcoming national legislative elections in October.

      "**Pioneers of Legal Abortion in Argentina Continue Their Advocacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Two decades after founding the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortion, activists like Martha Rosenberg, Marta Alanis, and Nelly Minyersky persist in their efforts to ensure full implementation of abortion rights in Argentina. The campaign, which gained momentum through support from National Women's Meetings and movements like #NiUnaMenos, achieved a significant milestone in 2020 with the passage of Law 27.610, allowing abortion up to 14 weeks of gestation. However, under President Milei's administration, attempts to repeal the law and suspend necessary resources have emerged. Facing an anti-rights government, these pioneers remain vigilant, emphasizing that abortion rights are integral to social justice, equality, and human rights, and are committed to defending the progress made.

      "**President Milei Proposes Plan to Repatriate Undeclared Dollars**\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 22, 2025, President Javier Milei introduced an economic initiative aimed at revitalizing Argentina's struggling economy by encouraging citizens to repatriate an estimated $270 billion in undeclared U.S. dollars held abroad or outside the official financial system. The plan eliminates tax reporting requirements for these funds, allowing their use for significant purchases without disclosing their origin. This move seeks to stimulate economic activity and advance Milei's vision of \"endogenous dollarization,\" where both pesos and dollars circulate freely. While officials argue the policy benefits ordinary savers affected by high taxes and inflation, critics warn it could facilitate tax evasion and money laundering. The International Monetary Fund has urged Argentina to maintain financial transparency despite these incentives.

      "**Violent Clashes Erupt Over Pension Protests Outside Congress**\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 22, 2025, dozens were injured during a protest outside Argentina's Congress in Buenos Aires, where retirees and activists demanded higher pensions. The demonstration coincided with a failed congressional session that lacked quorum to vote on key pension-related bills. President Milei's government opposes pension increases as part of a broader austerity strategy aimed at curbing high inflation and reducing public spending. This policy has sparked regular protests involving retirees, workers' unions, and other groups. Footage showed police using riot shields and batons against elderly demonstrators. Opposition lawmakers expressed outrage, highlighting the inadequacy of current pensions and accusing the government of negligence and cruelty. The administration maintains that financial limitations necessitate economic growth before raising pensions. Currently, about 38% of Argentina's population—approximately 11.3 million people—lives in poverty, a decrease from 53% during the previous half-year period.
